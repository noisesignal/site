<p>
Nucleo-L476RG development board integrates the ST-LINK debugger/programmer.

<p>
As stated in "UM1724 Rev 14" p25, if you snap off the development board, then:

	* If the communication between the target STM32 PA2 (D1) or PA3 (D0) and shield or extension board is required, 
	  SB62 and SB63 must be ON.
